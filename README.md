# Neutronics_MonteCarlo
Simple code to simulate Neutron Scattering in Non-Radiative matter using Monte Carlo simulations.

I have relied on a basic code structure that executes a 3-D random walk of Neutrons (Check PHY-302.pdf for details). Important parameters need to be manually inputted into the code structure, and these parameters can be found in the aforementioned pdf as a table.

Thanks for reading!
